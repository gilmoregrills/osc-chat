# sequencer

The sequencer can be used to schedule and send messages to the server. It comes pre-loaded with some randomly generated messages, and with all buttons set to `.`.

Clicking the `.` will toggle the button between `.` and `x`. When a button is set to `x` it will send the message configured for that track to the server.

Try adjusting the pre-loaded messages, or read up on the [message spec](/spec).
